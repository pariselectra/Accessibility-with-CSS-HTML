# Accessibility-with-CSS-HTML

## Description
This was the first challenge I completed in a coding bootcamp I took through the University of Texas at Austin in conjunction with Trilogy Education. The goal of this challenge was to showcase the introductory skills we had learned the first week of class: CSS, HTML, and Git. Although this project is relatively basic, it serves as a baseline for the projects I went on to complete throughout the duration of the course.

The goal of this challenge was to make a website more accessible. We were given a piece of existing code and were tasked with editing the project to include feautures that met basic accessibilty requirements. There were a few major hurdles to accessibility written within the code that made the website virtually impossible for screenreaders to scan. In order to fix these issues I, first added semantic elements to the HTML code, which means I labeled the divisions so the screenreader could distinguish between the page elements. Second, I added alternative text to the images. Of the seven images on the page, none of the images contained descriptions, which means screen readers are unable to process and relate the image to users. Finally, I edited the color scheme to make the contrast more accessible to the visually impaired.

This project helped build a necessary understanding of accessibility requirements. Accessibility requirements not only help people with visual impairments, but they also protect companies from being sued and adhere to government compliances. 

As a final touch, I added detailed comments to easily breakdown the code and make it a little more "accessible" for future developers and collaborators. Cleaning up the title code, putting both CSS/HTML code elements in sequential order, and labeling the CSS/HTML code via comments provide clarity for a viewing audience.
